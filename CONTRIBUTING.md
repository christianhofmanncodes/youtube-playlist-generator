# Code Contributions

## Before starting to code

Please follow these guidelines before starting to code your feature or bugfix.

- If you want to implement a bugfix or feature request from an existing issue, please comment on that issue that you will work on it. This helps me to coordinate what needs to be done and what not.
- If you want to implement a feature request without an existing issue, please create an issue, so we know what you are working on and discuss the feature.
