## Installation

Just download and run the newest version from the Releases.
Choose your file according to the operating system (Windows, Linux or macOS) you are using.

Launch the program. Now you can either create a new playlist by adding an URL or ID to the playlist one by one, or you can open a `.ytplaylist` file. If you want to save your playlist, you can save the playlist to a `.ytplaylist` file with all its items and the playlist title. Share it with a friend if you want.

## FAQ

### How did you come up with this project?

A friend of mine wanted to build a YouTube playlist with me. But I had no idea how to do it because I don't have a Google account and I didn't want to create one either. So I came up with the idea to develop a neat little program that could do that.

### What types of links are supported?

The program supports both YouTube and Invidious links of any type.

```bash
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=
https://www.youtu.be/
https://invidious.namazso.eu/watch?v=
```
